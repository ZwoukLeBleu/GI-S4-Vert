# GI-S4-Vert


# Testing 
## Requirements
- Python 3.x.x
- [VUnit](https://vunit.github.io/installing.html) VUnit from Python using `pip install vunit_hdl`.

- [GHDL](hhttps://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) with the LLVM backend.
> [!NOTE]
> If you are on Linux, this can be done with your package manager (apt, dnf, pacman, etc..)
>
> For Windows, its recommended to use MSYS2 for unified Unix-like interfaces
>
> For MacOS, you'll need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and install GHDL with it.


### Running the tests
Call `run.py` with your environment that has VUnit installed.
